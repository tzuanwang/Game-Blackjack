# Game-Blackjack

## Background
* Blackjack is a popular card game played in casinos. The goal is to get a hand with a value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
* The player is dealt (or draws) two cards and can choose to draw more or stop. The dealer is dealt two cards as well, but only one is visible to the player. The player wins if their hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand. But if they go over 21 they automatically lose. If the player and dealer have the same value, it's a tie.

## Basics
* Only two players, including the dealer
* Only one deck of cards, which is refilled after each round
* We are implementing a gambling system for the non-dealer player

## Cards
* There are 52 cards in a deck
* Each card has a suit (hearts, spades, diamonds, clubs) and there are 13 cards in each suit
* A card could be
    - numbered (2-10) and have the same point value
    - a face (jack, queen, king) and have a point value of 10
    - an ace and have a point value of 1 or 11, whichever is better for the player

## Game Round
* To start each round, both the dealer and the player are dealt two cards
* One of the dealer's cards is hidden from the player
* The player can choose to draw one more card until they go over 21 or decide to stop
    - If they go over 21, they lose and the round is over
* The dealer will draw until they have a hand value of N or more, where N is the player's hand value
    - If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins
* At the end, if the dealer's hand value is greater than the player's, the dealer wins

## Gambling
* A player can start with an arbitrary amount of money
* The player can bet as much money as they have
* The dealer will never run out of money

## Design 
* A Card will have a **Suit** and a **Value**
    - The suit is irrelevant for blackjack, but if our game had a UI it would be useful information.
    - Similarly, a ten, jack, queen, and king all have the same value, so we won't distinguish between them.
    - But these points would be worth clarifying. You don't want to overengineer a solution, but you also don't want to make major assumptions without clarifying with your interviewer.
* A **Deck** will have an array of **Cards**
    - The deck will be responsible for shuffling and popping (drawing) **Cards**
* A **Player** could be either the **Dealer** or the **User**, and since both will a **Hand**, the **Player** can be an abstract class
    - The **Player** will also be responsible for making a move (drawing or stopping)
* The **UserPlayer** will also have a **Balance** and be able to place a **Bet**
